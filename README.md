👋 Hi, I’m @Pastor-D

👀 I’m interested in solving complex real-world problems through Scientific Computing, building efficient Database Systems, and exploring the intersections of numerical modeling, high-performance computing, and data management.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in Numerical Methods, Graph Theory, and how High-Performance Computing can enhance simulations and data analysis. I am also exploring cutting-edge developments in Big Data and **Cloud Databases.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving simulation modeling, data visualization, and the integration of scientific computing with **database management systems to tackle large-scale data challenges.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via email or connect with me on platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy simulating weather patterns and analyzing complex data in my free time, and I’m always excited about discovering new algorithms or optimization techniques!
